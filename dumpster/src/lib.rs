//! A cycle-tracking concurrent garbage collector with an easy-to-use API.
//!
//! Most garbage collectors are _tracing_ garbage collectors, meaning that they keep track of a set
//! of roots which are directly accessible from the stack, and then use those roots to find the set
//! of all accessible allocations.
//! However, because Rust does not allow us to hook into when a value is moved, it's quite difficult
//! to detect when a garbage-collected value stops being a root.
//!
//! `dumpster` takes a different approach.
//! It begins by using simple reference counting, then automatically detects cycles.
//! Allocations are freed when their reference count reaches zero or when they are only accessible
//! via their descendants.
//!
//! Garbage-collected pointers can be created and destroyed in _O(1)_ amortized time, but destroying
//! a garbage-collected pointer may take _O(r)_, where _r_ is the number of existing
//! garbage-collected references, on occasion.
//! However, the cleanups that require _O(r)_ performance are performed once every _O(1/r)_ times
//! a reference is dropped, yielding an amortized _O(1)_ runtime.
//!
//! # Why should you use this crate?
//!
//! In short, `dumpster` offers a great mix of usability, performance, and flexibility.
//!
//! - `dumpster`'s API is a drop-in replacement for `std`'s reference-counted shared allocations
//!   (`Rc` and `Arc`).
//! - It's very performant and has builtin implementations of both thread-local and concurrent
//!   garbage collection.
//! - There are no restrictions on the reference structure within a garbage-collected allocation
//!   (references may point in any way you like).
//! - It's trivial to make a custom type Trace using the provided derive macros.
//! - You can even store `?Sized` data in a garbage-collected pointer!
//!
//! # Module structure
//!
//! `dumpster` contains 3 core modules: the root (this module), as well as [`sync`] and [`unsync`].
//! `sync` contains an implementation of thread-safe garbage-collected pointers, while `unsync`
//! contains an implementation of thread-local garbage-collected pointers which cannot be shared
//! across threads.
//! Thread-safety requires some synchronization overhead, so for a single-threaded application,
//! it is recommended to use `unsync`.
//!
//! The project root contains common definitions across both `sync` and `unsync`.
//! Types which implement [`Trace`] can immediately be used in `unsync`, but in order to use
//! `sync`'s garbage collector, the types must also implement [`Sync`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! If your code is meant to run as a single thread, or if your data doesn't need to be shared
//! across threads, you should use [`unsync::Gc`] to store your allocations.
//!
//! ```
//! use dumpster::unsync::Gc;
//! use std::cell::Cell;
//!
//! let my_gc = Gc::new(Cell::new(0451));
//!
//! let other_gc = my_gc.clone(); // shallow copy
//! other_gc.set(512);
//!
//! assert_eq!(my_gc.get(), 512);
//! ```
//!
//! For data which is shared across threads, you can use [`sync::Gc`] with the exact same API.
//!
//! ```
//! use dumpster::sync::Gc;
//! use std::sync::Mutex;
//!
//! let my_shared_gc = Gc::new(Mutex::new(25));
//! let other_shared_gc = my_shared_gc.clone();
//!
//! std::thread::scope(|s| {
//!     s.spawn(move || {
//!         *other_shared_gc.lock().unwrap() = 35;
//!     });
//! });
//!
//! println!("{}", *my_shared_gc.lock().unwrap());
//! ```
//!
//! It's trivial to use custom data structures with the provided derive macro.
//!
//! ```
//! use dumpster::{unsync::Gc, Trace};
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! #[derive(Trace)]
//! struct Foo {
//!     refs: RefCell<Vec<Gc<Foo>>>,
//! }
//!
//! let foo = Gc::new(Foo {
//!     refs: RefCell::new(Vec::new()),
//! });
//!
//! foo.refs.borrow_mut().push(foo.clone());
//!
//! drop(foo);
//!
//! // even though foo had a self reference, it still got collected!
//! ```
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! To use `dumpster`, add the following lines to your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! dumpster = "1.1.0"
//! ```
//!
//! # Optional features
//!
//! ## `derive`
//!
//! `derive` is enabled by default.
//! It enables the derive macro for `Trace`, which makes it easy for users to implement their
//! own Trace types.
//!
//! ```
//! use dumpster::{unsync::Gc, Trace};
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! #[derive(Trace)] // no manual implementation required
//! struct Foo(RefCell<Option<Gc<Foo>>>);
//!
//! let my_foo = Gc::new(Foo(RefCell::new(None)));
//! *my_foo.0.borrow_mut() = Some(my_foo.clone());
//!
//! drop(my_foo); // my_foo will be automatically cleaned up
//! ```
//!
//! ## `either`
//!
//! `either` is disabled by default. It adds support for the [`either`](https://crates.io/crates/either) crate,
//! specifically by implementing [`Trace`] for [`either::Either`](https://docs.rs/either/1.13.0/either/enum.Either.html).
//!
//! ## `coerce-unsized`
//!
//! `coerce-unsized` is disabled by default.
//! This enables the implementation of [`std::ops::CoerceUnsized`] for each garbage collector,
//! making it possible to use `Gc` with `!Sized` types conveniently.
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "coerce-unsized",
    doc = r#"
```
// this only works with "coerce-unsized" enabled while compiling on nightly Rust
use dumpster::unsync::Gc;

let gc1: Gc<[u8]> = Gc::new([1, 2, 3]);
```
"#

///
/// If the implementation of this trait is incorrect, this will result in undefined behavior,

/// This includes [`Trace::accept`], even though it is a safe function, since its correctness
/// is required for safety.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Implementing `Trace` for a scalar type which contains no garbage-collected references
/// is very easy.
/// Accepting a visitor is simply a no-op.
///
/// ```

///
/// struct Foo(u8);

/// unsafe impl Trace for Foo {
///     fn accept<V: Visitor>(&self, visitor: &mut V) -> Result<(), ()> {
///         Ok(())
///     }

/// ```
///
/// However, if a data structure contains a garbage collected pointer, it must delegate to its
/// fields in `accept`.
///
/// ```
/// use dumpster::{unsync::Gc, Trace, Visitor};
///
/// struct Bar(Gc<Bar>);

///         self.0.accept(visitor)
///     }

///
/// A data structure with two or more fields which could own a garbage-collected pointer should
/// delegate to both fields in a consistent order:
